Test project for execdiff

Steps to test (from this folder):

1. Install the local `execdiff` package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e ../../
```

2. Run the simple sanity script:

```bash
python3 test_install.py
```

This will print where `execdiff` was imported from and a small summary call.
